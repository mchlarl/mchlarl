## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm based in New York City and currently interning in the banking sector.
With over 7 years of sales experience, including 5 years in managerial roles, I've realized the immense power of data in driving business success.
This realization led me to pursue a bootcamp in business analytics, where I'm honing my skills to turn data into actionable insights.

My Primary Tech Skills in Data/Business Analytics:
1. Advanced Excel / Sheets
2. SQL
3. Tableau
4. MS Power BI

Fun Facts:
I’m a fan of pizza, especially with pineapple on top! 🍍🍕 (please don't forget to put pineapple on your pizza!)

I'm open to participating in outsourcing programs and collaborations.
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchellariel/

Looking forward to connecting and sharing ideas!
Michael
